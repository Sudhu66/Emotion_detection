# Overview
This project focuses on building a real-time emotion detection system using OpenCV and deep learning. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces, and classifies emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality. It leverages pre-trained deep learning models to analyze facial expressions and provide real-time feedback.
# Key Features:
Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
Emotion classification using a deep learning model trained on an emotion dataset (e.g., FER-2013).
Live webcam feed processing for detecting and displaying emotions.
Overlay detected emotions on the user's face with confidence scores.
Efficient processing with multi-threading and model optimization for real-time inference.
