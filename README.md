# Emotion_detection
This project focuses on building a real-time emotion detection system using OpenCV and deep learning. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces, and classifies emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality. It leverages pre-trained deep learning models to analyze facial expressions and provide real-time feedback.
